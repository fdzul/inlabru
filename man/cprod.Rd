\title{Cross product of integration points}
\usage{
cprod(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{\code{data.frame} or \code{SpatialPointsDataFrame} objects, each one usually obtained by a call to the \link{ipoints} function.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} or \code{SpatialPointsDataFrame} of multidimensional integration points and their weights
}
\description{
Calculates the cross product of integration points in different dimensions
and multiplies their weights accordingly. If the object defining points in a particular
dimension has no weights attached to it all weights are assumend to be 1.
}
\examples{
\donttest{
# Create integration points in dimension 'myDim' and 'myDiscreteDim' 
ips1 = ipoints(c(0,8), name = "myDim")
ips2 = ipoints(as.integer(c(1,2,3)), name = "myDiscreteDim")

# Calculate the cross product
ips = cprod(ips1, ips2)

# Plot the integration points
plot(ips$myDim, ips$myDiscreteDim, cex = 10*ips$weight)
}
