\title{Weighted summation (integration) of data frame subsets}
\usage{
int(data, values, dims = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A \code{data.frame} or \code{Spatial} object. Has to have a \code{weight} column with numeric values.}

\item{values}{Numerical values to be summed up, usually the result of function evaluations.}

\item{dims}{Column names (dimension names) of the \code{data} object to integrate over.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} of integrals, one for each level of the cross product of all dimensions not being integrated over.
}
\description{
A typicel task in statistical inference to integrate a (multivariate) function along one or
more dimensions of its domain. For this purpose, the function is evaluated at some points
in the domain and the values are summed up using weights that depend on the area being 
integrated over. This function performs the weighting and summation conditional for each level
of the dimensions that are not integrated over. The parameter \code{dims} states the the 
dimensions to integrate over. The set of dimensions that are held fixed is the set difference
of all column names in \code{data} and the dimensions stated by \code{dims}.
}
\examples{
\donttest{
# Create integration points in two dimensions, x and y

ips = cprod(ipoints(c(0,10), 10, name = "x"),
            ipoints(c(1,5), 10, name = "y"))

# The sizes of the domains are 10 and 4 for x and y, respectively.
# Integrating f(x,y) = 1 along x and y should result in the total
# domain size 40

int(ips, rep(1, nrow(ips)), c("x","y"))
}
